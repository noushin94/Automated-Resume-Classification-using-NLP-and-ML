# üìÑ Automated Resume Classification using NLP and ML

## üìö Introduction

In today's fast-paced job market, recruiters and hiring managers often face the daunting task of sifting through hundreds or even thousands of resumes for a single job opening. Automated resume classification and parsing can significantly streamline this process, ensuring that the most relevant candidates are identified quickly and efficiently. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), this project aims to classify resumes for different job roles, ultimately enhancing recruitment efficiency and effectiveness.

## üéØ Project Objective

This project combines NLP and ML techniques to classify different job roles based on resume content. The goal is to develop an automated system that accurately categorizes resumes, reducing the manual effort required in the hiring process.

## üîç Methodology

### Data Visualization

The first step involves visualizing the data to understand its structure and distribution. This helps in identifying patterns, outliers, and important features that can influence the classification process.

### Preprocessing

Preprocessing is crucial for preparing the data for NLP and ML models. The steps involved include:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Removing or imputing missing values to ensure data completeness.
- **Feature Selection**: Discarding features with less important information to focus on critical variables.
- **Text Cleaning**: Removing stop words, punctuation, and other irrelevant text elements.
- **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base or root form to normalize the text data.

### NLP Techniques

- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
- **Vectorization**: Converting text data into numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF or Word2Vec.

### Machine Learning Models

After preprocessing, the data is fed into various ML models to classify resumes. Commonly used models include:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Neural Networks**
